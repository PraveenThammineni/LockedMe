# LockedMe

LockedMe- Project Using Java

/********************** Project and Developer Details *******************/ This project aims to digitize the credentials for people to store their data. It was developed by Praveen Thammineni using Java programming language.

#Product Backlog

Create welcome screen.
Registration for users and store them.
Login users.
Add credentials for a user.
Delete credentials for a user.
Develop the insertion sort method.
Fetch credentials for a user.
Develop the binary search method.
Search credentials for a user.
#Sprints Details:

Sprint 1: 1 Day a. Create Welcome Screen b. Registration for Users and Store them c. Login Users
Sprint 2: 1 Day a. Add credentials for a user b. Delete credentials for a user
Sprint 3: 1 Day a. Develop the insertion sort method b. Fetch Credentials for a user
Sprint 4: 1 Day a. Develop the binary search method b. Search credentials for a user
Algorithms Used: • Insertion Sort: used to sort the data in an ascending order. It is used to fetch credentials and to sort data before doing the binary search. It is an efficient algorithm with an O(n^2) time complexity.

• Binary Search: used to search for a specific credential. It is a fast algorithm with an O(n) time complexity.

• Other algorithms: some created algorithms were used in the application such as to check the duplication for usernames and sites’ names when to register and to add new site.

Core concepts used in the project. • Object-Oriented: used to create and model objects for users and their credentials.

• Files and I/O: used to store and fetch the data of users and credentials instead of read database.

• Collections: used some collections such arraylist to store collection of data.

• Data Structures: some algorithms such as insertion sort and binary search used to increase the efficiency.

• Exception Handling: used to catch problems that arises in the code especially in I/O blocks.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this project is very simple and easy to use. And it's performance is good and use of Java concept is creatively.
